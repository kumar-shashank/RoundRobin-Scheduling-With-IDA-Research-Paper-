# RoundRobin-Scheduling-With-IDA

In this paper, we've proposed another variation of RR scheduling algorithm referred to as Improved Round Robin (IRR) Scheduling algorithm, by arranging the processes as per their shortest burst time and allotting all of them with an optimal time quantum which may diminish all the above said inconveniences. Experimentally we've shown that our proposed algorithm performs better than the RR algorithm, by lessening context switching, average waiting and average turnaround.
